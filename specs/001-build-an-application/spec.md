# Feature Specification: NeStA-Picker: Next Steam Achievement Picker

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-application`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an application that helps me pick the next Steam achievement to attempt from my current library. The app uses the official Steam API if possible, otherwise falls back to opening a Playwright browser session where the user logs in and data is scraped. Users can apply simple filters or pick an achievement at random. By default, the app only selects the next achievement, but browsing achievements is optional. Optionally, the user can enable LLM explanations via OpenRouter.ai (using ai-sdk and their own API key) to understand why a specific achievement was picked. Nice-to-have features include progress tracking, history/log of previous picks, and social sharing. The initial implementation can be a CLI with a colorful, well-designed interface built using a popular framework."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a Steam user, I want to easily find the next achievement to attempt in my game library, so I can stay engaged and make progress on my collection.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I have connected my Steam account, **When** I run the app, **Then** it suggests a single achievement for me to attempt.
2. **Given** I have a suggested achievement, **When** I request an explanation, **Then** the app tells me why that achievement was chosen.
3. **Given** I want to see more than one achievement, **When** I use the browse option, **Then** I can see a list of achievements.
4. **Given** I want to narrow down the achievements, **When** I apply a filter (e.g., by game), **Then** the suggestions are updated accordingly.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if the Steam API is unavailable? The app should fall back to using Playwright for data scraping.
- What happens if a user has no achievements or no games? The app should provide a clear message.
- How does the system handle invalid Steam credentials? The app should show an error and prompt the user to re-enter them.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to connect their Steam account.
- **FR-002**: System MUST fetch the user's game library and achievement status from Steam.
- **FR-003**: System MUST suggest a single achievement to the user by default.
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to pick an achievement at random.
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to apply simple filters to the achievement suggestions. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What filters should be available? e.g., by game, by completion percentage, etc.]
- **FR-006**: Users MUST have the option to browse all their achievements.
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide an optional explanation for why an achievement was picked, using an LLM.
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to provide their own OpenRouter.ai API key for the explanation feature.
- **FR-009**: The initial implementation MUST be a command-line interface (CLI).
- **FR-010**: The CLI MUST have a colorful and well-designed interface.

### Nice-to-Have Requirements (Optional)

- **NTH-001**: System SHOULD allow users to track their progress on achievements.
- **NTH-002**: System SHOULD maintain a history/log of previously picked achievements.
- **NTH-003**: System SHOULD allow users to share their achievements on social media. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which social media platforms?]

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **User**: Represents a Steam user, with their Steam ID and API key.
- **Game**: Represents a game in the user's library, with its name and list of achievements.
- **Achievement**: Represents a single achievement, with its name, description, and completion status.
