# Research & Decisions

## Testing Framework

- **Decision**: Use **Vitest** for testing.
- **Rationale**: Vitest is a modern, fast, and easy-to-use testing framework that is compatible with TypeScript and has a Jest-compatible API, making it a good choice for this project. It's also gaining popularity in the Node.js ecosystem.
- **Alternatives considered**: Jest. While Jest is a solid choice, Vitest is generally faster and requires less configuration.

## Performance Goals

- **Decision**: No specific performance goals are defined for the initial version. The focus is on functionality and user experience.
- **Rationale**: As a CLI tool for personal use, the initial performance requirements are not stringent. Performance can be optimized in later versions if needed.
- **Alternatives considered**: Defining specific goals (e.g., response time), but this is premature for the initial implementation.

## Scale/Scope

- **Decision**: The initial scope is for a single user.
- **Rationale**: The application is designed as a personal tool. It can be scaled in the future if there is demand.
- **Alternatives considered**: Building a multi-user system from the start, but this would add unnecessary complexity.
